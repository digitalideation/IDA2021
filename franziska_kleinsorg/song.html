    "I caught it bad" is referring to how quickly and badly he fell in love with his secret partner. Lil Nas X has not seen anyone (romantically) for a long time - probably because of COVID-19.
  </p> 


  <p class="annotation" id="text2">
    "White" stands for cocaine. Lil Nas X does not support the hedonistic, stoned, partying lifestyle many successfull people have. 
  </p>

  <p class="annotation" id="text3">
    This individual leads a "dark" lifestlyle.<br>
    It to be that Lil Na X'  secret partner is in a relationship with a woman. In Christianity, homosexuality is traditionally believed to be a sin, because God created Adam and Eve as a heterosexual couple.<br>
    Lil Nas X suggests to "commit adultery" (another sin) when his girlfriend isn't at home.
  </p> 

  <p class="annotation" id="text4">
    "Call Me By Your Name" (2007) by Andr√© Aciman is a romantic novel about two male lovers in a secret love affair. The story was famously adapted for the screen in 2017. <br> 
    Lil Nas X finally embraces himself (as well as his sexuality and origins) by mentioning his own first name "Montero", which he wants his lover to go by as an act of intimacy.<br>
    "Montero" is also the name of a fictional land, similar to the garden of Eden, where the corresponding music video is set.
  </p>

  <p class="annotation" id="text5">
    Lil Nas X becomes desperate. If his partner wants to have a certain thing, Lil Nas X wants to give that to him (or even become it). <br>
    The description of homosexual intercourse is still widely taboo - "shoot a child in your mouth while i'm riding" portrays gay sexuality in the same way that straight intimacy is often depicted in pop culture.
  </p> 

  <p class="annotation" id="text6">
    The track "Old Town Road" was on top of the charts for 19 weeks. Lil Nas X' fame makes him proud and changes his behaviour. <br>
    His openly gay identitiy is seen by some as a sign of "the world falling apart".
  </p>

  <p class="annotation" id="text7">
    Lil Nas X may be referring to a straight man who he is lusting after - someone out of his (gay) league.<br>
    The seven deadly sins include lust and envy - Lil Nas X is lusting after a man with better qualities than him. 
  </p> 

  <p class="annotation" id="text8">
    Their affair stays a secret but Lil Nas X is willing to keep it this way.
