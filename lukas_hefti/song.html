      Well, I'm so above you
      And it's plain to see
      But I came to love you anyway
      So you pulled my heart out
      And I don't mind bleedin'
      Any old time, you keep me waitin'
      Waitin', waitin'

      Oh, whoa, oh
      I got a love that keeps me waitin'
      Oh, whoa, oh
      I got a love that keeps me waitin'
      I'm a lonely boy
      I'm a lonely boy
      Oh, whoa, oh

      I got a love that keeps me waitin'
      Well, your mama kept you
      But your daddy left you
      And I should've done you just the same
      But I came to love you
      Am I born to bleed?
      Any old time, you keep me waitin'
      Waitin', waitin'

      Oh, whoa, oh
      I got a love that keeps me waitin'
      Oh, whoa, oh
      I got a love that keeps me waitin'
      I'm a lonely boy
      I'm a lonely boy
      Oh, whoa, oh

      I got a love that keeps me waitin'
      Hey
      Oh, whoa, oh
      I got a love that keeps me waitin'
      Oh, whoa, oh
      I got a love that keeps me waitin'
      I'm a lonely boy
      I'm a lonely boy
      Oh, whoa, oh
      I got a love that keeps me waitin'
