    <p>Hello Friends! <br> This is my background:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In 2019 I did the Foundation Course in Art and Design at HSLU.</li>
        <li>In 2020 I had the privilege to start studying Graphic Design and now I'm already in the second year of my bachelor.</li>
        <li>I'm in this course because I want to improve my coding skills and because I'm very interested in Digital Design. I really like working with design-programs like Figma and Adobe XD and hope I will be able to fully design and program my own website after this IDA-Course.</li>
    </ul>
