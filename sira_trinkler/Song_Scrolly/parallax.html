            Your house that sits behind me <br>
            Is covered in ivy green <br>
            The windows that we watch from <br>
            Are old and chipping at the beam <br>
            <br>
            It takes me away <br>
            It takes me away <br>
            Takes me away <br>
            It takes me away <br>
            It takes me away <br>
            Takes me away <br>
            <br>
            The scent you wear moves in lines <br>
            From your apartment into mine <br>
            You act like you don't know me <br>
            My God, you tempt my anxious mind <br>
            <br>
            It takes me away <br>
            It takes me away <br>
            Takes me away <br>
            It takes me away <br>
            It takes me away <br>
            Takes me away <br>
            <br>
            Would it be much better if I knew nothing about you? <br>
