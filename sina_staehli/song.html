        I want you to want me
        but you just wanna love me for the day.
        And I can‘t just walk away
        even though I know you‘re trouble, babe.
    
        So I‘mma take my time,
        go with the flow</a>, can‘t get too involved.
        You got a face that I
        just can‘t say no to.
        Just can‘t say no to you.
    
        You know I want you, baby.
        You know I do.
        I‘ll give you my heart and the rest is up to you.
        You ain‘t no good for me, I know it‘s true.
        But you don‘t have to be
    
        ‚cause I do it for the thrill, for the rush.
        I do it for the pain, for your touch.
        When I OD, when it‘s too much,
        if I survive, baby you‘re the one.
        You‘re the one.
    
        I feel like I‘m walking
        the tightrope of love in your circus, babe.
        If I were a fella it‘d be my last day
        even though you‘re right under me.
