                The default value for all elements is inline. Most “User Agent Stylesheets” (the default styles the
                browser applies to all sites) reset many elements to “block”. Let’s go through each of these, and then
                cover some of the other less common values. An inline
                element will accept margin and padding, but the element still sits inline as you might expect. Margin
                and padding will only push other elements horizontally away, not vertically.

                An element set to inline-block is very similar to inline in that it will set inline with the natural
                flow of text (on the “baseline”). The difference is that you are able to set a width and height which
                will be respected.

            <p>A number of elements are set to <code>block</code> by the browser UA stylesheet. They are usually
                container elements, like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and
                <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>. Also text “blocks” like <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>.
                Block level elements do not sit inline but break past them. By default (without setting a width) they
                take up as much horizontal space as they can.</p>
