  <h1>INZO - Overthinker</h1>


 <div>
  <p>A person who thinks all the time<br>
    Has nothing to think about except thoughts<br>
    So, he loses touch with reality<br>
    And lives in a world of illusions<br>
    
    By thoughts, I mean specifically, chatter in the skull<br>
    Perpetual and compulsive repetition of words<br>
    Of reckoning and calculating<br>
    I‘m not saying that thinking is bad<br>
    Like everything else, It‘s useful in moderation<br>
    A good servant, but a bad master<br>
    
    And all so-called civilized peoples<br>
    Have increasingly become crazy and self-destructive<br>
    Because, through excessive thinking<br>
    They have lost touch with reality<br>
    That‘s to say<br>
    We confuse 
    
    <span id="signs">signs</span>


    
    <br>
    With the real world<br>
    
    This is the beginning of meditation<br>
    
    Most of us would have<br>
    Rather money than tangible wealth<br>
    And a great occasion is somehow spoiled for us unless photographed<br>
    And to read about it the next day in the newspaper<br>
    Is oddly more fun for us than the original event<br>
    
    This is a disaster<br>
    For as a result of confusing the real world of nature with mere signs<br>
    We are destroying nature<br>
    We are so tied up in our minds that we‘ve lost our senses<br>
    
    Time to wake up<br>
    What is reality?<br>
    Obviously no one can say<br>
    Because it isn‘t words<br>
    It isn‘t material, that‘s just an idea<br>
    
    Reality is<br>
    
    The point cannot be explained in words<br>
    
    I‘m not trying to put you down<br>
    It‘s an expression of you as you are<br>
    One must live<br>
    We need to survive, to go on<br>
    We must go on<br></p>
