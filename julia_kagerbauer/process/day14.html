                Who has the Ginger?
                I woke up one day and planned to get reckless <br>
                Felt myself and put on my best necklace <br>
                Posted in the group chat, who wants to faaji? <br>
                They were only down for the after party <br>
                Hmmn, my body is ready <br>
                And it's sweeting me like I have jedi jedi <br>
                Who else would be hype? <br><br>
                Who has the Ginger?  <br> 
                Only this guy that I know through my sister <br>
                So I hit him up and told him let's roll <br>
                And he told me he'll pioneer the parole <br>
                Now it's a movement <br>
                The night can't waste <br>
                So I got some henny out the stash for a taste <br>
                Went out for pre-drinks, squad was chill <br>
                But as the time passed, shit got real <br>
                I mentioned the movement they said they'll come through <br>
                Now them too were ready to do the do <br>
                The whole squad turnt and the music is flames <br>
                And we don't even know anybody here's names <br>
                Can't even front, I have no ragrets <br>
                Lowkey one of my best nights yet <br>
                Oooh I'm on a big wave <br>
